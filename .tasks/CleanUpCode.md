# CleanUpCode

- [ ] Clean up the new code according to these guidelines:
  - Remove task-specific newly-added debugging statements (e.g., `console.log`, `puts`, `print`) that were temporarily used to debug transient issues during the session
  - Leave appropriate, consistent, and prior-art debug statements in place
  - Remove comments that are merely descriptive of what the code does
  - Remove new commented-out "TODO" blocks unless they are important
- [ ] Run lint to confirm no new warnings from removed code
- [ ] Do CommitCode.md
