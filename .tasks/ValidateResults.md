# ValidateResults

- [ ] Deploy the latest code to a local or staging environment (e.g., `npm run start`, `rails server`, or `docker-compose up`)
- [ ] Execute any manual “smoke tests” or end‐to‐end scenarios described in the spec.
- [ ] Confirm that all user stories from `CreateSpec.md` work as expected (check edge cases too)
- [ ] If external integrations exist (APIs, third‐party services), verify live calls return expected data
- [ ] Document any discrepancies or unsatisfied acceptance criteria
- [ ] If everything validates, mark this task done; otherwise, go to `FixErrors.md`
