# PushBranch

- [ ] Ensure you are on the correct feature branch: `git branch --show-current`
- [ ] Push your local commits to the remote: `git push origin $(git branch --show-current)`
- [ ] Go to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and open a Pull Request (PR) against `main` (or `develop`)
- [ ] In the PR description, reference the ticket number (if any) and summarize changes
- [ ] Assign reviewers and set any required labels (e.g., “feature,” “needs review”).
- [ ] Mark this task done once the PR is open
