See Overview.md for the format.

The tasks are intended to be copied into a project in .rune-spiral/tasks.

The user is then free to edit them, and create their own templates in that folder.

When a task is *akshually* run, it should get copied from the template into a subfolder for the "workstream" under the ./tasks folder in the app's root, either by a command, or the LLM, not sure. That way the templates don't get messed with.
